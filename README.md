## Branches

The author created a branch per each section of the course. I decided to create branches only for the sections listed here:

- [Server Side Rendering](https://github.com/iramirezc-learning/fem-intermediate-react-v2/tree/server-side-rendering)
- [TypeScript](https://github.com/iramirezc-learning/fem-intermediate-react-v2/tree/typescript)

## Notes about this branch `redux`

I wanted to merge this branch to `main` along with the tests, but tests broke. I might look some time in the future (or not) to make them work with redux.
